# Machine Learning Model Dashboard

Managing ML models in production used to mean scattered notebooks and manual deployment processes.
With this Reflex-powered platform, data science teams train, deploy, and monitor machine learning models from one unified interface. Track performance metrics, manage experiments, and ensure model reliability—all through an integrated MLOps dashboard.

**End users**
Data Scientists · ML Engineers · AI Researchers · DevOps Engineers

**Components**
Model Performance Charts · Training Progress Bars · Deployment Status Grid · Experiment Comparison Tables · Alert Notifications · Parameter Tuning Forms



### What you can build

* **Experiment Tracking Hub** – compare model runs, hyperparameter sweeps, and performance metrics with interactive visualizations and leaderboards.
* **Automated Training Pipeline** – schedule model retraining, handle data drift detection, and trigger alerts when performance degrades.
* **Model Deployment Manager** – deploy models to staging and production with A/B testing, canary releases, and rollback capabilities.
* **Performance Monitoring Suite** – track accuracy, latency, and resource usage with real-time dashboards and automated anomaly detection.
* **Data Quality Inspector** – monitor input distributions, detect drift, and validate data quality with statistical tests and visualizations.
* **Model Registry Console** – version control models, manage artifacts, and maintain lineage tracking across development lifecycle.

All logic is pure Python - integrate with your ML frameworks, cloud platforms, and monitoring tools to create a production-ready MLOps platform in minutes.
