# Deployment & Health Dashboard

If you run cloud services at scale, you need a cockpit that shows *exactly* what’s happening—right now.
This dashboard streams live metrics, rollout phases, and incident workflows onto one dark-mode screen so on-call engineers can catch anomalies, verify deployments, and resolve issues in seconds.

### What you can build

* **Unified Metrics Panel** – real-time charts for network I/O, CPU, memory, and concurrency with one-minute granularity.
* **Rollout Status Bar** – watch builds move from *Build → Canary → 25 % → 50 % → 100 %* with version tagging and a pause toggle.
* **Geo Traffic Map** – pinpoint regional bandwidth spikes and compare edge vs. instance throughput.
* **Incident Console** – open, acknowledge, or resolve P1–P4 incidents without leaving the app (swap stubs for PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or Jira).
* **Service Registry** – add micro-services on the fly and see health, CPU, memory, and latency snapshots.
* **Deployment History** – trigger new deploys and inspect progress or failures in a single table view.
* **Structured Logs** – filter by service and severity for fast root-cause analysis.

Behind the scenes, everything is pure Python with Reflex—swap the mock data pullers for Prometheus, Datadog, or CloudWatch, hook deployment webhooks from Argo or GitHub Actions, and you’ve got a production-ready operations cockpit in minutes.
