# Behavioral Ops Dashboard

The **Behavioral Ops Dashboard** is a cohort exploration tool that helps product and marketing teams **slice users into precise cohorts** using an intuitive drag-and-drop GUI.
Teams can export these cohorts or schedule them for continuous tracking, unlocking a deeper understanding of customer behavior across product usage, campaigns, and retention cycles.

This dashboard brings behavioral data closer to decision-makers by combining flexible segmentation logic with automated reporting and visualization.

* **Drag-and-Drop Segmentation** – empower non-technical teams with a GUI to create complex filters without SQL.
* **Scheduled Cohorts** – automate exports to BI tools, CRMs, or ad platforms for continuous monitoring.
