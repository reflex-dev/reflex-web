# Factor-Risk Analytics Dashboard

Running multi-factor risk models used to take hours—or days.
With this Reflex-powered dashboard, portfolio managers upload returns, launch a GPU-accelerated model run, and pivot the results in seconds. Drill into style, industry, or custom factors, compare portfolios side-by-side, and export compliant reports—all from one browser tab.


**Industry**
Asset Management · Hedge Funds · Investment Banking · Pension Funds

**End users**
Portfolio Managers · Risk Officers · Quant Researchers · Investment Analysts

**Components**
AG Grid Pivot Table · Line & Bar Charts · Heatmaps · KPI Cards · File-Upload Wizard · Progress Bars · Toggle Switches



### What you can build

* **X-Sigma-Rho Explorer** – slice and dice factor contributions with a drag-and-drop pivot table and spark-bar overlays.
* **Live GPU Run Monitor** – watch progress, ETA, and GPU utilization in real time; cancel or reprioritize queued jobs.
* **Value-at-Risk & Stress Tests** – visualize VaR ladders, shock scenarios, and tail-risk heatmaps across portfolios.
* **Model Fit & Back-tests** – track R², information ratios, and forecast accuracy against historical benchmarks.
* **Portfolio Comparison** – line up three models, highlight deltas with red/green heatmaps, and export a side-by-side PDF.
* **Alert Engine** – trigger email or Slack pings when beta, VaR, or exposure thresholds are breached.

All logic is pure Python - swap the mock data loaders for Databricks, Snowflake, or Bloomberg, and you’ve got a production-ready risk cockpit in minutes.
