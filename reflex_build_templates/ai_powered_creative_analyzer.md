# AI-Powered Creative Analyzer

Launching an ad that flops is expensive. This **AI-Powered Creative Analyzer** lets growth and creative teams upload a video file and—within seconds—see a color-coded heatmap of every frame, a simulated Return-on-Ad-Spend (ROAS) forecast, and actionable tips on what to fix before the campaign goes live.

### What you can build

* **Seamless Video Upload** – drag-and-drop MP4/MOV files up to 200 MB with progress bars and validation.
* **Instant Frame Scoring** – 1 fps extraction with a 0-100 quality score displayed as an interactive heatmap.
* **Simulated ROAS Forecast** – pseudo-random ROAS percentage (50–300 %) plus ±10 pp confidence interval stored with each analysis.
* **Flagged Frame Finder** – auto-detect low brightness, missing branding, or cluttered text and jump right to the timestamp.
* **Comparative Analysis** – pick two analyses and view side-by-side diffs to prove your creative tweaks worked.
* **Reporting & Sharing** – generate a branded PDF in one click or share a read-only link that expires in 7 days.
* **Analysis History** – lifetime ledger of every upload with sortable status, dates, and simulated ROAS scores.
* **Total Uploads Counter** – rolling tally of how many videos a user has analyzed, displayed in the top nav.
* **Role-based Access** – email/password auth with secure password reset (swap for SSO when you’re ready).

Behind the scenes, everything runs in pure Python with Reflex—swap the mock ROAS generator for a real ML model, plug in AWS S3 for storage, and you’ve got a production-ready creative intelligence cockpit in minutes.
