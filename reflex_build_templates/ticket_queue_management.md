# Ticket Queue Management

Managing support tickets across departments, tools, and priorities is a constant challenge.
This Reflex-powered dashboard simplifies the process—giving teams a centralized, intelligent view of incoming tickets, their status, and team assignments.

From auto-triage to dynamic filtering and SLA tracking, this system helps teams resolve issues faster and stay focused on what matters most.

### What you can build

* **Triage Dashboard** – auto-prioritize tickets using rules or ML-based classification (e.g. severity, customer tier, alert source).
* **Queue View by Team** – group tickets by team or assignee and visualize queue length, backlog age, and status distribution.
* **SLA Tracker** – show countdowns and warnings for approaching SLA breaches, helping agents prioritize critical issues.
* **Bulk Operations Panel** – select multiple tickets for reassignment, tagging, or escalation with one click.
* **Tag & Search Bar** – filter tickets by tag (e.g. "urgent", "security", "billing") or search across metadata and message content.
* **Ticket Timeline Viewer** – display full ticket histories, updates, and linked alerts for rapid context during resolution.

Built entirely in Python with Reflex, this dashboard can integrate seamlessly with Jira, Zendesk, ServiceNow, and internal ticketing systems—powering a smoother support workflow.
