### What you can build

* **Unified Executions Stream** – connect FIX sessions, REST APIs, or CSV drops to view all fills in one sortable grid.
* **Outlier Radar** – auto-detect price or size deviations beyond configurable σ-levels; color-code and comment inline.
* **Blotter PDF** – nightly PDF with firm branding, summary stats, full trade table, and highlighted anomalies—ready for regulators.
* **On-Demand Sync** – “Sync Now” button re-pulls today’s trades and refreshes flags in seconds.
* **Threshold Tuning Panel** – adjust detection sensitivity and instantly preview which trades will be flagged.
* **Venue Credential Vault** – manage API keys, FIX logins, and test connectivity without leaving the UI.
* **Flagged Trades CSV Export** – share anomaly lists with desk heads or auditors via one-click download.

Everything runs in pure Python with Reflex—swap the mock data ingestors for your OMS or FIX engine, connect SMTP for real emails, and you’ve got a production-grade compliance blotter in minutes.
