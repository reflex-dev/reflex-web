# Treasury & Liquidity Monitor

Corporate treasurers need a single cockpit for **exactly where cash sits—and where it’s headed next**.
This web app streams bank balances, settlement pipelines, and 30-day liquidity forecasts onto one real-time screen, then fires instant alerts the moment thresholds are breached.

### What you can build

* **Unified Cash Panel** – live balances across all banks and currencies, refreshing every two seconds.
* **Threshold Alerts** – user-defined upper / lower limits trigger on-screen banners and email notifications.
* **Settlement Tracker** – see pending settlements with status, counterparty, and expected clearing time at a glance.
* **30-Day Liquidity Forecast** – interactive charts project daily cash positions; tweak growth, FX, or settlement assumptions in real time.
* **Drill-Down Account View** – click any tile to inspect intraday movements, historical balances, and transaction history.
* **Alert Center** – review, acknowledge, and export a log of all triggered alerts for audit or compliance.
* **One-Click CSV Export** – download current alert logs.

Everything runs in pure Python with **Reflex**—swap the mocked data pullers for real banking APIs, forecasting models, or ERP feeds, and you’ve got a production-ready treasury cockpit in minutes.
