### What you can build

* **Claude-Like Assistant UI** – mimic the structured, minimal design of Claude with avatars, alternating message styles, and inline rendering.
* **Streaming Output Handler** – pipe tokens from your backend LLM API to the UI in real time for a responsive experience.
* **Prompt Input with Shortcuts** – capture multiline prompts, support keyboard shortcuts, and auto-focus for fast interaction.
* **Markdown + Code Blocks** – support rich markdown formatting, including headings, lists, code blocks, and inline styling.
* **Session Memory Viewer** – show or store conversation history to preserve context across multi-turn interactions.
* **Regenerate & Reset Actions** – include common UX actions like message regeneration and full conversation clearing.

This entire interface is built in Python with Reflex, making it easy to wire up with your backend inference engine, vector DB, or function-calling logic—no frontend code required.
