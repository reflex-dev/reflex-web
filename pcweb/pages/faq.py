Reflex is designed to be easy to get started with for those with no previous web development experience."

But even for skilled engineers, without experience in traditional frontend tools like Javascript or React, making a web app can be overwhelming and time-consuming. And once their app is created, deploying it is often a nightmare. Over the years, many low-code and no-code frameworks have tried to make web development more accessible, but they all have limitations and graduation risks compared to standard web frameworks. With Reflex, we have created a framework that lets developers leverage their existing Python skills to build and deploy apps without compromising on flexibility or customization."

Anonymous usage data allows us to understand how Reflex is used and how we can improve the product.

The following information is collected:

* Operating System, CPU Count, Memory
* Python / Reflex Version

### How to Opt-Out

To disable telemetry, set `telemetry_enabled=False` in your `rxconfig.py` file.

```python
config = rx.Config(
    app_name="hello",
    telemetry_enabled=False,
)
```

Alternatively, you can set the `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` environment variable to `False`.
