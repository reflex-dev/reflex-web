### Testimonials

1. "Reflex made it really easy to focus on building my app with Python and integrate the components I needed without the hassle of learning new front-end frameworks. I can just focus on one language and get it done. It also integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Azure through the use of container apps, app service, Application Gateway, and Azure Front Door, making deployment and scaling smooth and efficient."
