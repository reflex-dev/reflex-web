Reflex AG Grid seamlessly integrates AG Grid--a high-performance feature-rich data grid for major JavaScript frameworks (like React) that offers filtering, grouping, pivoting, and more-- into the Reflex ecosystem, bringing advanced data grid capabilities to Python developers building modern web applications.

## Why Reflex AG Grid?

Reflex has become more popular among Python developers working in banking and fintech--who need components like AG Grid for advanced data handling.
We're excited to announce that you can start building powerful data-driven applications with Reflex AG Grid today!
Install Reflex AG Grid with pip:

```bash
pip install reflex-ag-grid
```

**Note:** This is an initial release.
Check out the [open source repo](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-ag-grid) and our [docs](https://reflex.dev/docs/library/tables-and-data-grids/ag-grid/) for the latest version and any updates.

## What is AG Grid?

[AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com) is a feature-rich data grid library designed for displaying and manipulating tabular data in web applications.
With over a million monthly downloads, and 90% of the Fortune 500 companies using it, it's a leading solution for working with tabular data.
AG Grid offers a wide array of functionalities including:

- In-place cell editing
- Real-time data updates
- Pagination and infinite scrolling
- Column filtering, reordering, resizing, and hiding
- Row grouping and aggregation
- Built-in theming

The AG Grid team is dedicated to continually improving the library, ensuring it remains at the forefront of data grid technology.

## Reflex AG Grid vs. Reflex DataTable Components

While Reflex offers basic `rx.data_table` component out of the box, Reflex AG Grid takes data handling to the next level.
If you're working with large datasets, need advanced filtering and sorting capabilities, or require features like editable cells and export options, Reflex AG Grid is the ideal choice.

Some key advantages of Reflex AG Grid include:

- Superior performance with large datasets
- Extensive customization options
- Built-in features like column pinning and row grouping
- Seamless integration with Reflex's reactive programming model
- Support for both free (community) and enterprise AG Grid features

Similarly to Reflex, the core functionality of AG Grid is free and open-source.
For those needing even more power, AG Grid offers an enterprise version with additional features such as pivot tables, advanced groupings, and Excel export capabilities.
Reflex AG Grid supports both the community and enterprise versions â€“ you just need a valid AG Grid license key to unlock the enterprise features.

## Getting Started with Reflex AG Grid

Follow along for a brief step-by-step guide on how to use Reflex AG Grid to build an app like the one shown below! Press the "Fetch Latest Data" button to see the app in action.
Check out the full live [app](https://ag-grid-app.reflex.run) and [code](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-examples/tree/main/ag_grid_finance).

```python exec
import reflex as rx
def zoomed_out_iframe(src: str, title: str, width: str = "100%", height: str = "500px", zoom: float = 0.75):
    return rx.html(
        f"""
        <div style="width: {width}; height: {height}; overflow: hidden;">
            <iframe
                src="{src}"
                title="{title}"
                style="width: {int(100/zoom)}%; height: {int(100/zoom)}%; border: none; transform: scale({zoom}); transform-origin: 0 0;"
            >
            </iframe>
        </div>
        """
    )
```

```python eval
zoomed_out_iframe(
    src="https://ag-grid-app.reflex.run",
    title="AG Grid app",
    width="100%",
    height="500px",
    zoom=0.70  # Adjust this value to control the zoom level
)
```

This finance app uses Reflex AG Grid to display stock data in an interactive grid with advanced features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.
Selecting a row from the grid shows that companies stock data for the past 6 months in a line chart.
Let's review the code to see how Reflex AG Grid is used in this app.

### Setup

First we import the necessary libraries, including yfinance for fetching the stock data.

```python
import reflex as rx
from reflex_ag_grid import ag_grid
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
```

### Fetching and transforming data

Next, we define the State class, which contains the application's state and logic.
The `fetch_stock_data` function fetches stock data for the specified companies and transforms it into a format suitable for display in AG Grid.
We call this function when clicking on a button, by linking the `on_click` trigger of the button to this state function.

We define state variables, any fields in your app that may change over time (A Var is directly rendered into the frontend of the app).

The `data` state variable stores the raw stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance. We transform this data to round the values and store it as a list of dictionaries, which is the format that AG Grid expects. The transformed data is sorted by date and ticker in descending order and stored in the `dict_data` state variable.

The `datetime_now` state variable stores the current datetime when the data was fetched.

```python
# The list of companies to fetch data for
companies = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "META"]

class State(rx.State):
    # The data fetched from Yahoo Finance
    data: pd.DataFrame
    # The data to be displayed in the AG Grid
    dict_data: list[dict] = [\{}]
    # The datetime of the current fetched data
    datetime_now: datetime = datetime.now()

    def fetch_stock_data(self):
        self.datetime_now = datetime.now()
        start_date = self.datetime_now - timedelta(days=180)

        # Fetch data for all tickers in a single download
        self.data = yf.download(companies, start=start_date, end=self.datetime_now, group_by='ticker')
        rows = []
        for ticker in companies:
            # Check if the DataFrame has a multi-level column index (for multiple tickers)
            if isinstance(self.data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
                ticker_data = self.data[ticker]  # Select the data for the current ticker
            else:
                ticker_data = self.data  # If only one ticker, no multi-level index exists

            for date, row in ticker_data.iterrows():
                rows.append({
                    "ticker": ticker,
                    "date": date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
                    "open": round(row["Open"], 2),
                    "high": round(row["High"], 2),
                    "mid": round((row["High"] + row["Low"]) / 2, 2),
                    "low": round(row["Low"], 2),
                    "close": round(row["Close"], 2),
                    "volume": int(row["Volume"]),
                })

        self.dict_data = sorted(rows, key=lambda x: (x["date"], x["ticker"]), reverse=True)
```

```python
rx.button(
    "Fetch Latest Data",
    on_click=State.fetch_stock_data,
)
```

### Defining the AG Grid columns

The `column_defs` list defines the columns to be displayed in the AG Grid.
The `header_name` is used to set the header title for each column.
The `field` key represents the id of each column.
The `filter` key is used to insert the filter feature, located below the header of each column.

```python
column_defs = [
    ag_grid.column_def(field="ticker", header_name="Ticker", filter=ag_grid.filters.text, checkbox_selection=True),
    ag_grid.column_def(field="date", header_name="Date", filter=ag_grid.filters.date),
    ag_grid.column_def(field="open", header_name="Open", filter=ag_grid.filters.number),
    ag_grid.column_def(field="high", header_name="High", filter=ag_grid.filters.number),
    ag_grid.column_def(field="low", header_name="Low", filter=ag_grid.filters.number),
    ag_grid.column_def(field="close", header_name="Close", filter=ag_grid.filters.number),
    ag_grid.column_def(field="volume", header_name="Volume", filter=ag_grid.filters.number),
]
```

### Displaying AG Grid

Now for the most important part of our app, AG Grid itself!

- `id` is required because it uniquely identifies the Ag-Grid instance on the page.
- `column_defs` is the list of column definitions we defined earlier.
- `row_data` is the data to be displayed in the grid, which is stored in the `dict_data` State var.
- `pagination`, `pagination_page_size` and `pagination_page_size_selector` parameters enable pagination with specific variables in the grid.
- `theme` enables you to set the theme of the grid.

We set `theme` using the `grid_theme` State var in the `rx.select` component.
Every state var has a built-in function to set it's value for convenience, called `set_VARNAME`, in this case `set_grid_theme`.

```python
ag_grid(
    id="myAgGrid",
    column_defs=column_defs,
    row_data=State.dict_data,
    pagination=True,
    pagination_page_size=20,
    pagination_page_size_selector=[10, 20, 50, 100],
    theme=State.grid_theme,
    on_selection_changed=State.handle_selection,
    width="100%",
    height="60vh",
)
```

```python
class State(rx.State):
    ...
    # The theme of the AG Grid
    grid_theme: str = "quartz"
    # The list of themes for the AG Grid
    themes: list[str] = ["quartz", "balham", "alpine", "material"]

rx.select(
    State.themes,
    value=State.grid_theme,
    on_change=State.set_grid_theme,
    size="1",
)
```

The `on_selection_changed` event trigger, shown in the code above, is called when the user selects a row in the grid.
This calls the function `handle_selection` method in the State class, which sets the `selected_rows` state var to the new selected row and calls the function `update_line_graph`.

The `update_line_graph` function gets the relevant ticker and uses it to set the `company` state var.
The Date, Mid, and DateDifference data for that company for the past 6 months is then set to the state var `dff_ticker_hist`.

Finally it is rendered in an `rx.recharts.line_chart`, using `rx.recharts.error_bar` to show the DateDifference data which are the highs and the lows for the day.

```python
class State(rx.State):
    ...
    # The selected rows in the AG Grid
    selected_rows: list[dict] = None
    # The currently selected company in AG Grid
    company: str
    # The data fetched from Yahoo Finance
    data: pd.DataFrame
    # The data to be displayed in the line graph
    dff_ticker_hist: list[dict] = None

    def handle_selection(self, selected_rows, _, __):
        self.selected_rows = selected_rows
        self.update_line_graph()

    def update_line_graph(self):
        if self.selected_rows:
            ticker = self.selected_rows[0]["ticker"]
        else:
            self.dff_ticker_hist = None
            return
        self.company = ticker

        dff_ticker_hist = self.data[ticker].reset_index()
        dff_ticker_hist["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(dff_ticker_hist["Date"]).dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

        dff_ticker_hist["Mid"] = (dff_ticker_hist["Open"] + dff_ticker_hist["Close"]) / 2
        dff_ticker_hist["DayDifference"] = dff_ticker_hist.apply(
            lambda row: [row["High"] - row["Mid"], row["Mid"] - row["Low"]], axis=1
        )

        self.dff_ticker_hist = dff_ticker_hist.to_dict(orient="records")


rx.recharts.line_chart(
    rx.recharts.line(
        rx.recharts.error_bar(
            data_key="DayDifference",
            direction="y",
            width=4,
            stroke_width=2,
            stroke="red",
        ),
        data_key="Mid",
    ),
    rx.recharts.x_axis(data_key="Date"),
    rx.recharts.y_axis(domain=["auto", "auto"]),
    data=State.dff_ticker_hist,
    width="100%",
    height=300,
)
```
