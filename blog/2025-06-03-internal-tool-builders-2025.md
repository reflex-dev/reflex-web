**Your company has a bottleneck.** Critical internal tools that should take days to build are taking weeks or months. Simple requests for admin dashboards, customer portals, and reporting tools create delays across departments while pulling engineering resources away from revenue-driving features.

The numbers reveal the scope of the problem: **Engineering teams spend [40% of their time](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/survey-it-and-engineering-teams-spend-40-of-their-time-building-and-maintaining-internal-tools-and-workflows-distracting-from-building-products-that-actually-drive-business-revenue-301733700.html) building and maintaining internal tools.** That's two full days every week that could be spent on product development, customer acquisition, or more strategic initiatives.

Meanwhile, business teams wait in an endless queue for operational tools they need to do their jobs effectively.

**Internal tool builders solve this organizational bottleneck by letting teams build functional tools in hours, not weeks.** Instead of lengthy development cycles and competing priorities, you get the dashboards, workflows, and portals your organization needs.

Thereâ€™s quite a few internal tool builders on the market, each with its own strengths. So, **to help you select the best internal tool builder for your team, weâ€™ve tested dozens and compiled our favorites based on features and pricing.** Letâ€™s get into it.

## What Is an Internal Tool Builder?

Sometimes pre-built project management apps and workflow automation tools wonâ€™t suit your businessâ€™s needs. Maybe your workflow is unique, youâ€™re operating in a niche industry, or youâ€™re simply scaling too quickly for these apps to keep pace. Internal tools come in handy here, yet their development often gets sidelined in favor of other projects.

**Internal tool builders help your technical and non-technical teams create custom applications tailored to your operations without necessarily needing to code from scratch.** The idea is that your resulting internal tool will function more accurately and efficiently because itâ€™s built by and for your team.

The ease of building will depend on your chosen tool but, generally speaking, a major perk of internal tool builders is they significantly shorten the development process. Many providers offer a library of built-in components and visual interfaces, while others streamline the arduous process of connecting backend and frontend environments. **In other words, internal tool builders help your team focus on building meaningful solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.**

You can use internal tool builders to create various kinds of internal platforms. Some common use cases across departments include:

- A native inventory tracking system for your **ops** team
- A customer ticket triaging and response system for your **support** team
- More granular analytics tools for your **marketing** team


## Why Internal Tool Builders Are Gaining Popularity

**Frankly, building internal software from the ground-up has been unsustainable for a while now.** Weâ€™re seeing momentum now because recent advancements in AI and ML have unlocked a greater world of possibility for non-technical teams. Rather than forcing a fit with off-the-shelf SaaS platforms or switching between dozens of programming languages, you can now create purpose-built tools that match the way you actually work.

The result? Better workflows, clearer visibility, and more productive teamwork across departments.


## How We Chose the Top Internal Tool Builders

**In the process of making this list, we assessed the core features of dozens of internal tool builders.** For starters, a platform needed to meet basic criteria regarding data security and SOC 2 compliance to be included.

Additionally, we assessed each tool on the following factors:

- **Integrations**: What additional tools or databases does the platform integrate with?
- **Scalability**: How does the tool meet the needs of small teams vs. enterprises? Does the tool scale naturally or create stumbling blocks for growth?
- **Performance**: How does the tool perform under greater data loads?
- **Development options**: Does the tool provide no-code, low-code, or full-code support?
- **Customization**: Does the tool provide support for more complex and flexible workflows?

**Ultimately, we gave extra weight to platforms that empower teams to ship fast without sacrificing quality or long-term maintainability.**

## What Are No-Code, Low-Code, and Full-Code?

**Full-code platforms provide frameworks for building internal tools from the ground-up.** This approach gives your developer team control and better customization, but it also comes with the highest lift.

**No-code and low-code solutions are a better match for less technical teams or those looking to significantly increase the efficiency of their development process.**

No-code platforms gamify the coding process with drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built components. The downside is, theyâ€™re often less customizable as a result.

Meanwhile, low-code solutions strike a nice balance by offering no-code options (i.e., easy, non-developer-oriented interfaces), as well as the option to write code when needed.

**Low-code platforms are great options for technical teams that want to move fast but still need flexibility and logic customization.**
