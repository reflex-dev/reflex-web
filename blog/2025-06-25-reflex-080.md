We're excited to announce the release of Reflex 0.8.0, a significant milestone that brings enhanced performance, cleaner architecture, and improved developer experience to our Python web framework. After extensive testing through multiple alpha releases, this version represents one of our most substantial updates yet.

## The Big Change: From Next.js to React Router

**Reflex 0.8.0 marks a major architectural transformation** as we migrate from Next.js to React Router as our underlying frontend framework. This fundamental change is the driving force behind all the performance improvements and enhanced developer experience in this release.

### Why We Made the Switch

The transition from Next.js to React Router allows us to:

- **Significantly improve development performance** with faster hot reloads and build times
- **Reduce bundle size** and improve runtime performance for your applications
- **Simplify the development workflow** with more predictable behavior
- **Better align with modern single-page application (SPA) patterns**
- **Reduce complexity** in our framework internals

### What This Means for Performance

The React Router migration delivers substantial performance improvements across the board:

- **Faster Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** - Development reloads are now significantly faster
- **Reduced build times** - Your applications compile and deploy more quickly
- **Optimized routing** - Client-side navigation is smoother and more responsive
- **Smaller bundle sizes** - Your applications load faster for end users
- **Improved memory usage** - Better resource management during development and production

### Enhanced Developer Experience

The architectural shift also brings significant developer experience improvements:

- **More predictable behavior** during development with cleaner state management
- **Simplified deployment** with streamlined build processes
- **Better error handling** and debugging capabilities
- **Cleaner environment variable handling** with proper `REFLEX_` prefixing requirements
- **Improved static file handling** and asset management

## Breaking Changes and Deprecation Cleanup

**Important**: Reflex 0.8.0 removes several previously deprecated features. Please review your code before upgrading:

### Removed Deprecated Features

- **`UploadFile.filename`** (deprecated in 0.7.1) - Use `UploadFile.name` instead
- **`App.error_boundary`** (deprecated in 0.7.1) - Use `App.app_wraps` 
- **`App.api`** (deprecated in 0.7.9) - Use `api_transformer=your_fastapi_app`
- **`App.add_custom_404_page`** (deprecated in 0.6.7) - Use `add_page` with `/404` route
- **Non-prefixed config environment variables** (deprecated in 0.7.13) - Now require `REFLEX_` prefix
- **Various Gunicorn configuration variables** - Use direct Gunicorn environment flags instead

### Environment Variable Changes

All Reflex configuration environment variables now require the `REFLEX_` prefix:
```bash
# Old (no longer supported)
ENV_FILE=.env

# New (required)
REFLEX_ENV_FILE=.env
```

## Migration Guide

The transition from Next.js to React Router is handled automatically by Reflex, but there are some important steps to ensure a smooth upgrade:

### Automatic Migration

**Good news**: The Next.js to React Router migration is handled automatically by the framework. Your existing Reflex applications will continue to work without code changes in most cases.

### Manual Steps Required

1. **Update your installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install reflex==0.8.0
   ```

2. **Update environment variables** to use the `REFLEX_` prefix:
   ```bash
   # Old (no longer supported)
   ENV_FILE=.env
   
   # New (required)
   REFLEX_ENV_FILE=.env
   ```

3. **Review deprecated features** in your codebase and update accordingly (see breaking changes above)

4. **Test your application thoroughly**, paying special attention to:
   - **Routing behavior** - navigation between pages
   - **File upload functionality** - update any `UploadFile.filename` usage
   - **Custom 404 pages** - migrate to the new `add_page` method
   - **Environment variable usage** - ensure all use the `REFLEX_` prefix

5. **Clean rebuild** (recommended):
   ```bash
   reflex clean
   reflex init  # if prompted
   reflex run
   ```

### Performance Validation

After upgrading, you should notice:
- Faster development server startup
- Quicker hot reloads during development  
- Improved build times
- More responsive application performance

## Community Testing and Feedback

This release benefited greatly from our community's participation in the alpha testing program. Through versions 0.8.0a1 through 0.8.0a4, developers provided valuable feedback that helped us identify and resolve issues before the stable release.
