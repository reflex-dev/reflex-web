## Stop Starting From Scratch

Every developer knows the feeling: you’ve got a clear idea in your head, maybe even a sketch on a whiteboard. But before you can test it with real users, you have to grind through setup. Wiring state, scaffolding pages, connecting a database, writing the same boilerplate you wrote last week.

By the time the foundation is ready, the excitement is gone. What if you could skip straight to the fun part?

## Meet Reflex Build

[Reflex Build](https://build.reflex.dev/) is our AI-powered builder that takes a simple prompt — *“Give me a sales dashboard with charts, filters, and a database connection”* and turns it into a working Reflex app.

Not a toy. Not a mockup. A real app you can run, edit, and deploy.

Think of it as your co-founder who handles all the boring scaffolding so you can focus on the parts that matter.

## From Prompt to Product

Here’s what a typical workflow looks like with Reflex Build:

1. **Connect your data** — This step is optional, but if you have external data, paste in a database URL or choose an integration to load the data.
2. **Describe your app** — tell Reflex Build what you want: *“AI-driven support dashboard with ticket search, alert timelines, and user profiles.”*
3. **Watch it appear** — in less than a minute, you’ve got pages, components, and state wired together.

At this point you’re not staring at boilerplate. You’re clicking through a live app that already feels real.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src="/blog/reflex_build_example.png",
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        rx.text(
            'Generated from the prompt: "Give me a sales dashboard with charts, filters, and a database connection."',
            class_name="text-sm text-slate-10 mt-2 italic",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer py-2",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

## Why Reflex Build Feels Different

There are plenty of “AI app generators” out there. Most stop at prototypes, pretty wireframes you can’t actually ship. Reflex Build is different. It's a Python first AI builder that creates enterprise ready apps you can take straight to production:

- **Production-first**: It generates actual Reflex code you can extend, not locked-in templates.
- **Theming built-in**: Charts, forms, and tables inherit your app’s look automatically.
- **Real integrations**: Connect to databases, APIs, and auth providers the same way you would by hand.
- **Fast iteration**: Change the prompt, regenerate, and keep what you like.

Instead of bolting AI on top of your workflow, Reflex Build is woven directly into it.

## Who It’s For

- **Solo devs** who want to move fast without drowning in boilerplate.
- **Product teams** that need working scaffolds to customize and ship.
- **Founders** who want to turn an idea into a testable app over a weekend.
- **Enterprise teams** that require production ready apps, real integrations, and the flexibility to extend in Python.

If you’re building dashboards, admin panels, or internal tools, Reflex Build is like starting a sprint with 70% of the work already done.

## The Future of App Development

We believe the future isn’t *AI replacing developers*. It’s AI working with developers in Python, where enterprise teams already build their most critical apps. Open up Reflex Build, type your first prompt, and see what you can create in minutes.
