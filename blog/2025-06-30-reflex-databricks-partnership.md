```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

We're excited to announce our official **partnership with Databricks**—and the launch of our **Reflex AI Builder integration with Databricks Apps**.

Reflex is built specifically for **Python teams and data professionals**. You can now generate and deploy full internal apps directly on top of your Databricks data—using just Python and a few prompts.

No JavaScript. No frontend boilerplate. No DevOps headaches.

### Bridging the Prototype-to-Production Divide

Enterprise teams today are stuck between two extremes:

1. **Low-code tools** like Streamlit, Plotly Dash, Gradio, or Power BI — great for fast prototyping, but limited in customization, scalability, and governance.
2. **Full-stack frameworks** like React + FastAPI — powerful and production-ready, but require front-end teams, infra setup, and weeks of coordination.

Reflex bridges this gap - we're building a framework that scales from **prototype to production**.

We let Python teams start fast *and* scale—without switching platforms. You can build something scrappy to test an idea, then grow it into a robust production app with authentication, state management, and secure deployment—all from the same codebase.

### From Prompt to Production, Without Leaving Python

If you've ever built a notebook or script that someone asked to "turn into an app," you know the pain: hand it off to frontend, wrangle deployment, or worse—abandon it entirely.

Reflex fixes that by letting Python teams go from data to full production apps in minutes—without switching stacks.

With our AI Builder, you can:

- Connect to your **Databricks catalog** (Unity Catalog support included)
- Prompt Reflex to generate app logic, UI, and interactions
- Deploy instantly to **Databricks Apps** inside your secure environment

Every app includes:

- **Python-native business logic** and state management
- **Secure data access** governed by Unity Catalog
- **AI-generated UIs** that you can extend with code—or leave as-is
- **Role-based access controls** and enterprise-grade deployment

Whether it's a dashboard, workflow tool, or LLM-powered interface—if you can describe it in Python or plain English, you can ship it with Reflex.

And because Reflex apps run directly inside **Databricks Apps**, your data never leaves your stack. No vendor lock-in. No platform rewrites. Just Python, from prototype to production.

### Get Started

If you're using Databricks and your team writes Python, Reflex lets you build apps as fast as you write scripts—without waiting on frontend or DevOps help.

We're already helping teams migrate legacy tools and build new ones faster using AI + Python + Databricks.
