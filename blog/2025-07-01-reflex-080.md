# Reflex v0.8.0 - Moving Forward

Reflex v0.8.0 represents a major milestone in our journey to make Python web development faster and more reliable. This release includes two fundamental architectural changes that improve both developer experience and application performance.

We had achieved **2-3x faster production build times** with our migration from NextJS to Vite + Rolldown, **18% faster component initialization** with our custom Pydantic replacement, **significantly reduced memory usage** during development and builds, and **faster component compilation** across the board.

## NextJS is just too much

Reflex compiles its frontend to a NextJS project. For production builds, we use NextJS Server-Side-Rendering to pre-render the majority of the application so it can be served statically without NodeJS dependency. We also leverage its development server for iterative development. NextJS is much more than what we use it for, and that is our issue with it.

### Turbopack (or lack thereof)

Turbopack is wonderful, when it works. NextJS has generally overpromised and underdelivered with turbopack and its stability. For many of our usecases, it was very much unusable. [When we reported these bugs upstream](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/77218) (by the way, please do report bugs upstream), it was one of the slowest to respond.

We had to disable turbopack because of the above bug, and opt in for a much older version of NextJS that does not have this issue. Overall, turbopack massively improved things, but when you export NextJS for downstream users, it is not reliable just yet.

### Is the grass greener on the other side?

NextJS is popular for a good reason. Is there really anything better?

Switching away from React is a non-starter, so that takes away things like Vue/Nuxt and Svelte/SvelteKit. We do need some Single-Page-Application-like routing, so we cannot just use vanilla React. This leaves us with two options:

1. **React-Router** (merged with Remix). They recently had their v7 release which cleaned up the weird transitional state they are in.
2. **Tanstack Router**. They are a bit new (around three years old) but they had their v1 release for some time now.

We ruled out Tanstack for now. It might be potentially cool for the future but we needed to move off of NextJS now, not later.

React-Router is generally, promising. They are more restricted as React-Router mostly just does, routing. It delegates most of the work to Vite.

### You have heard that? Vite!

Vite is wonderful. Even when we have issues with it, they are much less random and mysterious. They are much more active on fixing bugs. They are so good that basically everyone but NextJS uses them.

Vite is already fast, but it can be even faster if you use [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/). Oh it is in beta? If Rolldown is beta you should take NextJS back to alpha.

### Time for a rewrite

This one is big. That is basically our biggest dependency really, after Python. We merged a three-month work in [#4984](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/pull/4984). We had to do lots of cleanups after to make sure features remained compatible as reasonable as possible.

We also opted to use Rolldown. Simply, our experience using it was much less buggier than NextJS. We have yet to hit a Rolldown bug in our apps.

### Expect much faster builds

We have yet to enable Rolldown's experimental native plugins (we did hit some issues on those). Although we should be doing so hopefully soon. Even without them, Vite with Rolldown is consistently **two to three times faster** than NextJS and uses much less memory.

## A tale of Pydantic V1

### How did we come here?

Reflex had its initial commit in November of 2022. During which, Pydantic was during its V1 era. It was not until June of 2023 that Pydantic V2 was released. Although upgrade should be easy, right?

It is obvious that Pydantic V2 would not maintain backwards compatibility with V1. The issue is that we were not using Pydantic _internally_, but we were reexporting Pydantic classes for downstream users of Reflex to use. Mainly, we had two major components that were tightly attached to Pydantic.

First there is `reflex.State`. It defines the schema, i.e. fields and events, for a client session (a user visiting the website).

The public API looks like:

```python
class IndexState(rx.State): # Inherit from rx.State for State functionality
    name: str = "" # A string field with a default value
    messages: list[str] = [] # A mutable field

    @rx.event # A function invoked from the frontend
    def on_new_message(self, message: str):
        self.messages.append(message) # Mutates and notifies the client
```

The fact that `rx.State` was implemented through Pydantic was mostly a hidden detail. Although the specifics of how Pydantic processed fields was essentially public API. Things like mutable defaults being handled without a default constructor, fields starting with `_` being ignored and not at all processed by Pydantic, and other weirdly specific details. As such, upgrading has always been a difficult task, espically if you really wanted to maintain API compatibility.

Second, there is `reflex.Component`. It defines the schema of a Python class that would compile into a Javascript invocation of a React component. Similar to `reflex.State`, it also package Pydantic's public API to Reflex downstream, and maintaining backwards compatibility was desired.

### Why bother?

Pydantic has always been a weird fit for our usecase at Reflex. For one, Pydantic's blurb on PyPI says:

> Data validation using Python type hints

...while we do not actually use validation for most of our classes. We hand rolled our own validation that works with our `reflex.Var` system. Pydantic just offered _so_ much that we were not using, and we needed to pay for that extra every time we define a class or create an instance of it.

[#4904](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/pull/4904) is one example of things just, being bad. Where Pydantic was checking the mutability of _every_ default field at _every_ instance creation. The culprit is this line in `pydantic/v1/fields.py`:

```python
def get_default(self) -> Any:
    return smart_deepcopy(self.default) if self.default_factory is None else self.default_factory()
```

Things are still _largely_ fine. Although we set `self.default` to an instance of `reflex.Var`, which is a frozen dataclass, and Pydantic takes the _long_ route of deepcopying the dataclass instead of just returning it. This makes `smart_deepcopy` take around 50x longer than it needs to. Changing things to `default_factory` with a constructor lambda fixes this issue.

While we could continue to track down such behavior in Pydantic, it does show a bit of limitation in our case. We did not write Pydantic, so we do not know what is just, bad Pydantic code. This issue magnifies if you export Pydantic classes for your downstream users to subclass from.

### Where do we go from here?

We could upgrade to Pydantic V2 and either face the API breakage for us and for our downstream, or we could patch all V1 behavior we can think of into Pydantic V2. As time continued without making a decision, the former looked too difficult to commit to, and the latter seemed a more significant work than desired.

We opted to choose neither, and rewrite Pydantic from scratch! Well, we only used a small subset of features from Pydantic, so it was not a terrible task. You can take a look at the two pull requests: [#5289](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/pull/5289) and [#5396](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/pull/5396) to get some insight on how that was implemented. Those rewrites allowed us to clean up Pydantic patches and control our logic. It also boosted our performance on our existing benchmarks. **Roughly 18% faster** on initializing components and similar improvements on compiling stateful components.

For other classes that we do not expect downstream to subclass, we opted for traditional dataclasses as API breakage there is expected.

## What's Next

These foundational improvements set the stage for even more exciting features coming in future releases. We're continuing to focus on making Reflex the fastest and most reliable way to build web applications with Python.
