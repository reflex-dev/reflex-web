## First Steps

Reflex makes it easy to create a simple Web UI running from a single Python file:

```python
import reflex as rx


@rx.page()
def index():
    return rx.center(
        rx.heading("Hello Reflex! ðŸ‘‹")
    )


app = rx.App()
```

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

```python eval
rx.card(
    rx.center(
        rx.heading("Hello Reflex! ðŸ‘‹")
    ),
    width="100%",
    margin_y="5em",
)
```

However, as the app grows, keeping everything in a single module can quickly
become messy and unmanageable.

Because a Reflex app is just a Python project, it can be organized into modules
and packages (directory with `__init__.py`) and imported like any other Python objects.

## What Makes a Reflex App?

When executing `reflex init` or `reflex run`, the framework will import **two** modules automatically.

### Config: `rxconfig.py`

Reflex first looks for an `rxconfig.py` in the current working directory and
imports it.  At minimum, it defines a module-level global named `config` as
an instance of `rx.Config`, of which the only required setting is `app_name`.

```python
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(app_name="example_big_app")
```

### App Module: `\{app_name}/\{app_name}.py`

After loading the config, Reflex imports the main app module based on the
`app_name`, which defines a module-level global named `app` as an instance
of `rx.App`.

If the app_name is `example_big_app`, then the main module would be
`example_big_app/example_big_app.py`.

The main app module is responsible for importing all other modules that make up the
app and defining `app = rx.App()`. **All other modules containing pages, state,
and models MUST be imported (directly or indirectly) by the main app module**
for Reflex to include them in the compiled output.

## Breaking the App into Smaller Pieces

The key to good organization as the app grows is to break down all parts of the app into
smaller, more manageable modules, and organize them into logical packages that avoid circular
dependencies.

### Pages

#### Pages Package: `example_big_app/pages`

All complex apps will have multiple pages, so it is recommended to create `example_big_app/pages`
as a package.

This package contains one module per page in the app. If a particular page depends on the state, the substate should
be defined in the same module as the page. The page-returning function should be decorated with `rx.page()`
to have it added as a route in the app.

```python
import reflex as rx

from ..state import AuthState


class LoginState(AuthState):
    def handle_submit(self, form_data):
        self.logged_in = authenticate(form_data["username"], form_data["password"])


def login_field(name: str, **input_props):
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.text(name.capitalize()),
        rx.input(name=name, **input_props),
        width="100%",
        justify="between",
    )


@rx.page(route="/login")
def login():
    return rx.card(
        rx.form(
            rx.vstack(
                login_field("username"),
                login_field("password", type="password"),
                rx.button("Login"),
                width="100%",
                justify="center",
            ),
            on_submit=LoginState.handle_submit,
        ),
    )
```

#### Templating: `example_big_app/template.py`

Most apps consist of a common page layout and structure which wraps the content
for each page. It is helpful to define that layout in a separate module so it
can be easily shared when constructing pages.

In a Reflex app, any common frontend UI elements can be factored out as a
function that returns a component. If a function accepts a function that
returns a component, it can be used as a decorator as seen below.

```python
from typing import Callable

import reflex as rx

from .components.menu import menu
from .components.navbar import navbar


def template(page: Callable[[], rx.Component]) -> rx.Component:
    return rx.vstack(
        navbar(),
        rx.hstack(
            menu(),
            rx.container(page()),
        ),
        width="100%",
    )
```

The `@template` decorator should appear below the `@rx.page` decorator and above the page-returning function.

## State Management

Most pages will use State in some capacity. You should avoid adding vars to a
shared state that will only be used in a single page. Instead, define a new
subclass of `rx.State` and keep it in the same module as the page.

### Accessing other States

As of Reflex 0.4.3, any event handler can get access to an instance of any other
substate via the `get_state` API. From a practical perspective, this means that
state can be split up into smaller pieces without requiring a complex
inheritance hierarchy to share access to other states.

In previous releases, if an app wanted to store settings in `SettingsState` with
a page or component for modifying them, any other state with an event handler
that needed to access those settings would have to inherit from `SettingsState`,
even if the other state was mostly orthogonal. The other state would also now
always have to load the settings, even for event handlers that didn't need to
access them.

A better strategy is to load the desired state on demand from only the event
handler which needs access to the substate.

#### A Settings Component: `example_big_app/components/settings.py`

```python
import reflex as rx


class SettingsState(rx.State):
    refresh_interval: int = 15
    auto_update: bool = True
    prefer_plain_text: bool = True
    posts_per_page: int = 20


def settings_dialog():
    return rx.dialog(...)
```

#### A Post Page: `example_big_app/pages/posts.py`

This page loads the `SettingsState` to determine how many posts to display per page
and how often to refresh.

```python
import reflex as rx

from ..models import Post
from ..template import template
from ..components.settings import SettingsState


class PostsState(rx.State):
    refresh_tick: int
    page: int
    posts: list[Post]

    async def on_load(self):
        settings = await self.get_state(SettingsState)
        if settings.auto_update:
            self.refresh_tick = settings.refresh_interval * 1000
        else:
            self.refresh_tick = 0

    async def tick(self, _):
        settings = await self.get_state(SettingsState)
        with rx.session() as session:
            q = Post.select().offset(self.page * settings.posts_per_page).limit(settings.posts_per_page)
            self.posts = q.all()

    def go_to_previous(self):
        if self.page > 0:
            self.page = self.page - 1

    def go_to_next(self):
        if self.posts:
            self.page = self.page + 1


@rx.page(route="/posts", on_load=PostsState.on_load)
@template
def posts():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.foreach(PostsState.posts, post_view),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("< Prev", on_click=PostsState.go_to_previous),
            rx.button("Next >", on_click=PostsState.go_to_next),
            justify="between",
        ),
        rx.moment(interval=PostsState.refresh_tick, on_change=PostsState.tick, display="none"),
        width="100%",
    )
```

### Common State: `example_big_app/state.py`

_Common_ states and substates that are shared by multiple pages or components
should be implemented in a separate module to avoid circular imports. This
module should not import other modules in the app.

## Component Reusability

The primary mechanism for reusing components in Reflex is to define a function that returns
the component, then simply call it where that functionality is needed.

Component functions typically should not take any State classes as arguments, but prefer
to import the needed state and access the vars on the class directly.

### example_big_app/components

This package contains reusable parts of the app, for example headers, footers,
and menus. If a particular component requires state, the substate may be defined
in the same module for locality. Any substate defined in a component module
should only contain fields and event handlers pertaining to that individual
component.


## Database Models: `example_big_app/models.py`

I prefer to implement all database models in a single file to make it easier to
define relationships and understand the entire schema. However, if the schema is
very large, it might make sense to have a `models` package with individual
models defined in their own modules. At any rate, defining the models separately
allows any page or component to import and use them without circular imports.


## Top-level Package: `example_big_app/__init__.py`

This is a great place to import all state, models, and pages that should be part of the app.
Typically, components and helpers do not need to imported, because they will be imported by
pages that use them (or they would be unused).

```python
from . import state, models
from .pages import index, login, post, product, profile, schedule

__all__ = [
    "state",
    "models",
    "index",
    "login",
    "post",
    "product",
    "profile",
    "schedule",
]
```

If any pages are not imported here, they will not be compiled as part of the app.

## example_big_app/example_big_app.py

This is the main app module. Since everything else is defined in other modules, this file becomes very simple.

```python
import reflex as rx

app = rx.App()
```

## File Management

There are two categories of non-code assets (media, fonts, stylesheets,
documents) typically used in a Reflex app.

### assets

The `assets` directory is used for **static** files that should be accessible
relative to the root of the frontend (default port 3000). When an app is deployed in
production mode, changes to the assets directory will NOT be available at runtime!

When referencing an asset, always prefer to use a leading forward slash, so the
asset can be resolved regardless of the page route where it may appear.

### uploaded_files

If an app needs to make files available dynamically at runtime, it is
recommended to set the target directory via `REFLEX_UPLOADED_FILES_DIR`
environment variable (default `./uploaded_files`), write files relative to the
path returned by `rx.get_upload_dir()`, and create working links via
`rx.get_upload_url(relative_path)`.

Uploaded files are served from the backend (default port 8000) via
`/_upload/<relative_path>`

## Putting it all together

Based on the previous discussion, we recommend a project layout that might look like this.

```text
example-big-app/
â”œâ”€ assets/
â”œâ”€ example_big_app/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ components/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ __init__.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ auth.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ footer.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ menu.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ navbar.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ pages/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ __init__.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ login.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ posts.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ product.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ profile.py
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ schedule.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ __init__.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ example_big_app.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ models.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ state.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ template.py
â”œâ”€ uploaded_files/
â”œâ”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€ rxconfig.py
```

## Takeaways

- Like any other Python project, **split up the app into modules and packages** to keep the codebase organized and manageable.
- Using smaller modules and packages makes it easier to **reuse components and state** across the app
  without introducing circular dependencies.
- Create **individual functions** to encapsulate units of functionality and **reuse them** where needed.
