The following is a sales app that displays sales data. The table tab allows filtering and live updates. The graph tab shows the relationship between sales data.

## Setup

To run this app locally, install Reflex and run:

```bash
reflex init --template sales
```

To run the app, use:

Set the OpenAI API key:
```
export OPEN_AI_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
reflex run
```

## Customizing the Inference

Note: You can get your OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

You can customize the app by modifying the `sales/sales/backend/backend.py` file replacing OpenAI's API with that of other LLM providers.
