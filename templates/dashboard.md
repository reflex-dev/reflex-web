The following is a dashboard to interactively display data some data. It is a good starting point for building more complex apps that require data visualization.

## Setup

To run this app locally, install Reflex and run:

```bash
reflex init --template dashboard
```

To run the app, use:

```bash
reflex run
```

## Customizing to your data

Right now the apps reads from a local CSV file. You can modify this by changing the `DATA_FILE` variable in the `dashboard/dashboard/backend/table_state.py` file.

Additionally you will want to change the `Item` class to match the data in your CSV file.

```python
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass
class Item:
    """The item class."""

    name: str
    payment: float
    date: str
    status: str
```
