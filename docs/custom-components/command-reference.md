The custom component commands are under `reflex component` subcommand. To see the list of available commands, run `reflex component --help`. To see the manual on a specific command, run `reflex component <command> --help`, for example, `reflex component init --help`.

```python eval
doccmdoutput(
    command="reflex component --help",
    output="""Usage: reflex component [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Subcommands for creating and publishing Custom Components.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  init     Initialize a custom component.
  build    Build a custom component.
  share    Collect more details on the published package for gallery.""")
```

## reflex component init

Below is an example of running the `init` command.

```python eval
doccmdoutput(
    command="reflex component init",
    output="""reflex component init

The `init` command uses the current enclosing folder name to construct a python package name, typically in the kebab case. For example, if running init in folder `google_auth`, the package name will be `reflex-google-auth`. The added prefix reduces the chance of name collision on PyPI (the Python Package Index), and it indicates that the package is a Reflex custom component. The user can override the package name by providing the `--package-name` option.

The `init` command creates a set of files and folders prefilled with the package name and other details. During the init, the `custom_component` folder is installed locally in editable mode, so a developer can incrementally develop and test with ease. The changes in component implementation is automatically reflected where it is used. Below is the folder structure after the `init` command.

```python eval

    "border": "1px solid var(--c-slate-4)",
    "background": "var(--c-slate-2)",
    "color": "var(--c-slate-12)",
    "font-family": "Source Code Pro",
    **code
  }
)
```

### pyproject.toml

The `pyproject.toml` is required for the package to build and be published. It is prefilled with information such as the package name, version (`0.0.1`), author name and email, homepage URL. By default the **Apache-2.0** license is used, the same as Reflex. If any of this information requires update, the user can edit the file by hand.

### README

The `README.md` file is created with installation instructions, e.g. `pip install reflex-google-auth`, and a brief description of the package. Typically the `README.md` contains usage examples. On PyPI, the `README.md` is rendered as part of the package page.

### Custom Components Folder

The `custom_components` folder is where the actual implementation is. Do not worry about this folder name: there is no need to change it. It is where `pyproject.toml` specifies the source of the python package is. The published package contains the contents inside it, excluding this folder.

`reflex_google_auth` is the top folder for importable code. The `reflex_google_auth/__init__.py` imports everything from the `reflex_google_auth/google_auth.py`. For the user of the package, the import looks like `from reflex_google_auth import ABC, XYZ`.

`reflex_google_auth/google_auth.py` is prefilled with code example and instructions from the [wrapping react guide]({wrapping_react.overview.path}).

### Demo App Folder

A demo app is generated inside `google_auth_demo` folder with import statements and example usage of the component. This is a regular Reflex app. Go into this directory and start using any reflex commands for testing. The user is encouraged to deploy the demo app, so it can later be included as part of the [Gallery]({gallery.path}).

### Help Manual

The help manual is shown when adding the `--help` option to the command.

```python eval
doccmdoutput(
    command="reflex component init --help",
    output="""Usage: reflex component init [OPTIONS]

  Initialize a custom component.

  Args:     library_name: The name of the library.     install: Whether to
  install package from this local custom component in editable mode.
  loglevel: The log level to use.

  Raises:     Exit: If the pyproject.toml already exists.

Options:
  --library-name TEXT             The name of your library. On PyPI, package
                                  will be published as `reflex-{library-
                                  name}`.
  --install / --no-install        Whether to install package from this local
                                  custom component in editable mode.

```

## reflex component publish

To publish to a package index, a user is required to already have an account with them. As of **0.7.5**, Reflex does not handle the publishing process for you. You can do so manually by first running `reflex component build` followed by `twine upload` or `uv publish` or your choice of a publishing utility.

You can then share your build on our website with `reflex component share`.

## reflex component build

It is not required to run the `build` command separately before publishing. The `publish` command will build the package if it is not already built. The `build` command is provided for the user's convenience.

The `build` command generates the `.tar.gz` and `.whl` distribution files to be uploaded to the desired package index, for example, PyPI. This command must be run at the top level of the project where the `pyproject.toml` file is. As a result of a successful build, there is a new `dist` folder with the distribution files.

```python eval
doccmdoutput(
    command="reflex component build --help",
    output="""reflex component build --help
Usage: reflex component build [OPTIONS]

  Build a custom component. Must be run from the project root directory where
  the pyproject.toml is.

  Args:     loglevel: The log level to use.

  Raises:     Exit: If the build fails.

Options:
  --loglevel [debug|info|warning|error|critical]
                                  The log level to use.  [default:
                                  LogLevel.INFO]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
