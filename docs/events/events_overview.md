# Events Overview

Events are composed of two parts: Event Triggers and Event Handlers.

- **Events Handlers** are how the State of a Reflex application is updated. They are triggered by user interactions with the UI, such as clicking a button or hovering over an element. Events can also be triggered by the page loading or by other events.

- **Event triggers** are component props that create an event to be sent to an event handler.
Each component supports a set of events triggers. They are described in each [component's documentation]({library.path}) in the event trigger section.


## Example 
Lets take a look at an example below. Try mousing over the heading to change the word.

```python demo exec
class WordCycleState(rx.State):
    # The words to cycle through.
    text: list[str] = ["Welcome", "to", "Reflex", "!"]

    # The index of the current word.
    index: int = 0

    def next_word(self):
        self.index = (self.index + 1) % len(self.text)

    @rx.var
    def get_text(self) -> str:
        return self.text[self.index]

def event_triggers_example():
    return rx.heading(
        WordCycleState.get_text,
        on_mouse_over=WordCycleState.next_word,
        color="green",
    )

```

In this example, the heading component has the **event trigger**, `on_mouse_over`.
Whenever the user hovers over the heading, the `next_word` **event handler** will be called to cycle the word. Once the handler returns, the UI will be updated to reflect the new state.

# What in this section?

In the event section of the documentation, you will explore the different types of events supported by Reflex, along with the different ways to call them.
