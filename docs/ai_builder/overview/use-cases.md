## Use Cases by Industry

Organizations across industries use **Reflex** to build internal tools, dashboards, and AI-driven applications—all in pure Python. From finance to healthcare, Reflex helps teams move faster by simplifying full-stack development.

### 1. Financial Services

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
    rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(rx.image(src="/case_studies/bayesline_app.png", border_radius="10px", alt="Bayesline App")),
        class_name="py-4"
    )
```

From buyside analytics desks to compliance back offices, finance teams choose **Reflex** because a single Python codebase can stream market data, crunch GPU-heavy models, and satisfy audit trails—without juggling separate front-end frameworks or ETL schedulers. With AG Grid built into the product, analysts iterate and hand a production-grade web app to traders or risk officers the same day.


**Examples of apps you can build in Reflex:**

- **Factor-Risk Analytics Dashboard** – GPU-powered analytics dashboard that delivers custom equity-factor risk models in minutes instead of weeks
- **End-of-Day Trade Blotter** – automatically pulls executions from every venue, flags outliers, and emails a compliance-ready PDF to traders each night.
- **Asset-Allocation Simulator** – visualizes portfolio mixes and projected returns over time; users drag weight sliders and instantly see downside and drawdown scenarios.
- **Treasury & Liquidity Monitor** – streams balances, pending settlements, and cash forecasts into a single real-time dashboard with threshold alerts.
- **Loan-Underwriting Workflow** – scores new credit applications against live KYC/AML data, routes edge cases for manual review, and retrains the model on a weekly schedule.

### 2. E-commerce & Advertising

```python eval
    rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(rx.image(src="/case_studies/sellerx_app.png", border_radius="10px", alt="Sellerx App")),
        class_name="py-4"
    )
```

Modern merchants and growth marketers juggle stock feeds, ad platforms, and customer-service queues that rarely live in the same tool. **Reflex** lets teams wire those APIs together—from Amazon listings to TikTok ads—then ship production dashboards or scheduled automations with nothing but Python. The result: faster decisions on pricing, spend, and fulfillment, plus fewer hops between spreadsheets and BI tools.

**Examples of apps you can stand up in Reflex:**

- **Inventory & Pricing Command Center** – unifies marketplace sales (e.g. Amazon), real-time stock alerts, and supplier lead times in a single view.
- **Campaign Control Plane** – tracks multi-channel ad spend and ROI, enforces budget caps, and auto-generates performance reports.
- **AI-Powered Creative Analyzer** – runs frame-level video ad scoring to predict ROAS before campaigns go live.
- **Refund & Returns Console** – pulls tickets from the help-desk, payment events from Stripe, and warehouse data to approve refunds in seconds.
- **Multichannel Attribution Dashboard** – blends ad-platform metrics, web analytics, and order revenue to surface true customer-acquisition cost in real time.

### 3. Engineering & DevOps

```python eval
    rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(rx.image(src="/case_studies/devops_app.png", border_radius="10px", alt="DevOps App")),
        class_name="py-4"
    )
```

Site-reliability, platform, and security teams use **Reflex** to surface real-time telemetry, automate routine infra tasks, and replace shell scripts with role-based web UIs—all in pure Python.

**Examples of apps you can stand up in Reflex:**

- **Deployment & Health Dashboard** – combines service metrics, rollout status, and incident timelines in one screen for on-call engineers.
- **VM Lifecycle Manager** – grants ops staff a secure web panel to start, stop, snapshot, or tag virtual machines—no CLI access required.
- **Factory & Machine-Monitoring Portal** – streams sensor data from multiple plants, flags anomalies, and predicts downtime with live charts.
- **Supply-Chain Automation Viewer** – visualizes robot and conveyor status in distribution centres; integrates with third-party control APIs for fast triage.
- **Security-Ops Command Center** – unifies BigQuery logs, ticket data, cloud storage, Firestore, Salesforce CRM records, and PagerDuty alerts so analysts can hunt threats and track user activity in a single interface.

### 4. Database Admin & CRUD

```python eval
    rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(rx.image(src="/case_studies/admin_app.png", border_radius="10px", alt="Admin App")),
        class_name="py-4"
    )
```

Database admins can spin up Python-native panels that let teams **read, write, and update** their data through polished tables, forms, and charts. With **Reflex**, full-featured database dashboards and CRUD apps come together in minutes—no separate front-end stack, no raw CLI sessions.

**Examples of CRUD-first apps you can stand up in Reflex:**

- **Role-Based Postgres Admin Panel** – browse, edit, or bulk-import customer rows while keeping finance-only fields hidden behind granular permissions.
- **Inventory Catalog Manager** – one screen to adjust stock levels, pricing rules, and supplier SKUs that sync instantly to every sales channel.
- **Content & Data-Exchange Portal** – upload new CAD drawings, attach metadata, and version files for manufacturing projects, all stored in a single database.
- **Team Management Console** – create, disable, or time-limit user accounts and access tokens for internal SaaS tooling, complete with audit logs.
- **Supply-Chain Config Editor** – operations staff tweak warehouse routing rules and robotics parameters through validated forms that write directly to production tables.

### 5. Data Science & Analytics

Data scientists and analysts can convert their notebooks into production-grade apps that expose models, metrics, and datasets through live tables, charts, and custom Python components.

**Examples of analytics apps you can stand up in Reflex:**

- **ML-Service Admin Console** – register experiment runs, visualize attention maps or confusion matrices, and promote the best model to production with one click.
- **Behavioural Cohort Explorer** – drag-and-drop filters to segment users by events, demographics, and funnels, then export cohorts or schedule recurring reports.
- **Fleet Metrics Self-Serve Dashboard** – slice and visualize vehicle telemetry (mileage, battery health, utilisation) so operations teams answer questions in seconds—no SQL required.
- **Delivery Operations Dashboard** – monitors driver efficiency and delivery performance in real time, highlighting bottlenecks and automatically flagging late orders.
- **Dataset Versioning & Quality Monitor** – upload new snapshots, run validation tests, and graph distribution shifts or missing-value spikes over time.

### 6. AI & Document Workflows

When files, forms, recordings, and chat threads produce more raw information than teams can manually review, **Reflex** converts that unstructured content into structured, actionable insight. OCR, speech-to-text, and large-language-model pipelines plug directly into Python UIs, then push validated results to dashboards, search endpoints, or downstream APIs—no additional middleware or bespoke glue code.

**Examples of AI-driven document apps you can stand up in Reflex:**

- **Training-Session Hub** – records live video classes, transcribes speech in real time, and lets coaches search by keyword to jump to any moment.
- **Smart Document Viewer** – highlights key fields (prices, SKUs, dates) as users scroll and writes the extracted values to a structured database with one click.
- **Image-to-GPS Calibration Tool** – accepts bulk image uploads, matches them to GNSS logs, and visualizes camera extrinsics for quick QA.
- **Enterprise Knowledge Chat** – an LLM interface that answers staff questions using contracts, wikis, and ticket history—kept secure behind SSO.
- **Support & Deal-Flow Console** – shows live agent SLAs while a background workflow ingests tens of thousands of new company profiles each month; vector search and natural-language filters surface the best leads in seconds.
