# Deploy App

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

It is easy to deploy your app into production from Reflex Build to Reflex Cloud.

Simply click the `Deploy` button in the bottom right corner of Reflex Build, as shown below:



```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom

def render_image():
    return rx.el.div(
        image_zoom(
            rx.image(
                src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/deploy_light.png",
                    "/ai_builder/app_lifecycle/deploy_dark.png",
                ),
                class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
                border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
            ),
            class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
        ),
        class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
    )
```

```python eval

rx.el.div(render_image())

```

When deploying you can set the following options:
- **App Name**: The name of your app
- **Hostname**: Set your url by setting your hostname, i.e. if you set `myapp` as your hostname, your app will be available at `myapp.reflex.run`
- **Region**: The regions where your app will be deployed
- **VM Size**: The size of the VM where your app will be deployed
- **Secrets**: The environment variables that will be set for your app, you can load the variables currently being used by your app by clicking the `Load from settings` button

Note: Hostname customization, region selection, and VM sizing are only available on paid plans.
