# Templates

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

Reflex has many certified templates, seen on the `Trending` tab of the Reflex Build, that can be used to kickstart your app. You can also use any app created by the community as a template. 

## Using a Template

To use a template, simply click the template and then in the bottom right corner of the app click the `Fork` button. This will create a copy of the template in your own account. You can then edit the app as you like with further prompting.

Below is an example of how to use a template:

```python eval
rx.image(
    src="/ai_builder/using_templates.gif",
    height="auto",
    padding_bottom="2rem",
)
```

Templates are great to get started if they have similar UI to what you are looking to build. You can then add your own data to the app.
