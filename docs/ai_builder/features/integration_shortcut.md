# Integrations Shortcut

Reflex Build supports powerful integrations like databases, OpenAI, and Databricks, allowing you to connect external services to your app without complex setup. These integrations help you add advanced functionality—like AI-powered features, data analytics, or persistent storage—while speeding up development.

The **Add Integrations** button makes it easy to connect external services to your app while chatting with the AI Builder. A panel with a list of available integrations will appear, you can quickly add integrations that your app can reference and connect to.

Once in your app, you can access your integrations by clicking the flow or cog icon in the bottom left inside the chat area.

```python exec
import reflex as rx
from reflex_image_zoom import image_zoom
```

```python eval
rx.el.div(
    image_zoom(
        rx.image(
            src=rx.color_mode_cond(
                "/ai_builder/features/shortcut_light.webp",
                "/ai_builder/features/shortcut_dark.webp",
            ),
            class_name="p-2 rounded-md h-auto",
            border=f"0.81px solid {rx.color('slate', 5)}",
        ),
        class_name="rounded-md overflow-hidden",
    ),
    class_name="w-full flex flex-col rounded-md cursor-pointer",
)
```
