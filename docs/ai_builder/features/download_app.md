# Download your App

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

It is easy to download your app to work on locally or self-host. (It is recommended to use the GitHub integration, but if this is not possible, you can download your app to work on locally.) 

Simply click the `Download` button in the bottom right corner of Reflex Build, as shown below:


```python eval
rx.image(
    src="/ai_builder/download_app.gif",
    height="auto",
    padding_bottom="2rem",
)
```
