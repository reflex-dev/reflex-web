# File Tree

The **File Tree** in Reflex Build lets you **view, organize, and manage all files and folders** in your project directly from the browser. It’s your central hub for navigating your app’s structure.

## Key Features

### Creating Folders
- Click the **New Folder** button to create a folder inside the currently selected directory.
- Enter a name and press **Enter** to confirm.
- Folders can be nested to organize your project hierarchically.

### Creating Files
- Click the **New File** button to create a file inside the current folder.
- Enter a file name and extension (e.g., `main.py`) and press **Enter**.
- Files are immediately visible in the tree and ready for editing in the code editor.

### Renaming Files or Folders
- Right-click on a file or folder and select **Rename**.
- Type the new name and press **Enter** to confirm.
- Renaming automatically updates references in your project where applicable.

### Deleting Files or Folders
- Right-click on a file or folder and select **Delete**.
- Deleted items are permanently removed, so be careful when deleting important files.

### Drag-and-Drop from System
- Drag files or folders from your computer directly into the File Tree.
- The editor will automatically import them into the selected folder.
- This works for individual files or entire folder structures, making adding assets or scripts quick and easy.
