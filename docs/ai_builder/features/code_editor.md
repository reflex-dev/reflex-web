## IDE Features

### Real-Time Editing

Changes you make in the editor are immediately reflected across your project—no manual saves or rebuilds required. Stay in flow and iterate faster.

### File & Folder Management

Easily create, rename, or delete files and folders directly in the workspace. The file tree gives you full visibility into your application structure at all times.

### Drag-and-Drop File Upload

Seamlessly import files into your project by dragging them straight into the editor. Whether you're adding assets, scripts, or config files, it's fast and intuitive—no extra clicks required.

### Context-Aware Code Editor

The built-in code editor supports syntax highlighting, inline error detection, and AI-assisted suggestions to help you write clean, efficient code with confidence.

### One-Click Deployment

From the IDE, you can deploy your app with a single click. No terminal, no external tools—just build and ship straight from your browser.
