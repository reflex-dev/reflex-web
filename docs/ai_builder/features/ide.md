## IDE Features


### Real-Time Editing

Changes you make in the editor are immediately reflected across your project—no manual saves or rebuilds required. Stay in flow and iterate faster.

### File & Folder Management

Easily create, rename, or delete files and folders directly in the workspace. The file tree gives you full visibility into your application structure at all times.

### Context-Aware Code Editor

The built-in code editor supports syntax highlighting, inline error detection, and AI-assisted suggestions to help you write clean, efficient code with confidence.

### One-Click Deployment

From the IDE, you can deploy your app with a single click. No terminal, no external tools—just build and ship straight from your browser.
