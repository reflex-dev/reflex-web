# Gemini Integration

The **Gemini Integration** allows your app to use [Google’s Gemini models](https://aistudio.google.com/) for text generation, reasoning, multimodal analysis, and other advanced AI capabilities. Once connected, you can call Gemini directly from your workflows, UI actions, or automated triggers.

## Step 1: Obtain a Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Get API Key** or create a new key for your project.
3. Copy the generated key.

   * **Example:** `AIzaSyDxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

## Step 2: Configure the Integration in Your App

1. Go to **Integrations → Add Gemini** in your app settings.  
2. Paste your **Gemini API Key** in the input field.  
3. Click **Connect** to validate and save your integration.

Once connected, your app can use Gemini for AI-powered features across workflows and components.

## Step 3: Notes

* **Keep your key secure:** Do not hardcode your Gemini API key in public code repositories.  
* **Use environment-specific keys:** Separate dev, staging, and production keys help manage access and security.  
* **Secure API access:** The key allows your app to interact with Gemini endpoints securely and efficiently.
