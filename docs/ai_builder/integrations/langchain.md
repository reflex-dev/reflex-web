# Langchain Integration
The **LangChain Integration** allows your app to leverage the power of [LangChain](https://langchain.com/), a popular open-source framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). Once connected, your app can orchestrate complex AI workflows, chain together multiple model calls, and integrate with various data sources and tools seamlessly.


You can:

* **Chain model calls together** to create multi-step reasoning flows.
* **Connect multiple providers** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq) through a single interface.
* **Build intelligent agents** that can use tools, call APIs, or access external data sources dynamically.
* **Work with structured data** by combining LLMs with databases, vector stores, and retrieval systems.
* **Create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipelines to ground model outputs in your own data.
* **Integrate tools and memory** so models can reason over past interactions and context.
* **Deploy reusable components** like prompt templates, chains, and agents for production-grade applications.

LangChain essentially acts as a **“glue layer”** between language models, data, and logic — enabling teams to build more **powerful and reliable AI apps** without reinventing core orchestration features.


## Configure the Integration in Your App

1. Click the **Settings** gear icon and navigate to the **Integrations** tab.
2. Find and enable the **LangChain** integration.
