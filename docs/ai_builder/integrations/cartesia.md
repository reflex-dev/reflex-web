# Cartesia Integration

The **Cartesia Integration** allows your app to generate **high-quality, realistic speech from text** using Cartesia’s advanced voice models. Once connected, you can easily add real-time voice capabilities to workflows, user interactions, and automated experiences.


## Step 1: Obtain a Cartesia API Key

1. Go to the [Cartesia Console](https://www.cartesia.ai/).  
2. Log in or create an account.  
3. Navigate to **API Keys** in your account settings.  
4. Click **New**, give it a descriptive name (e.g., “AI Builder”), and copy it.  
   - Example: `sk_car_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`



## Step 2: Configure the Integration in Your App

1. Open your app and go to **Integrations → Add Cartesia**.  
2. Paste your **Cartesia API Key** in the input field.  
3. Click **Connect** to validate and save your integration.  

Once connected, your app can convert text to speech seamlessly in real time or through workflows.



## Step 3: Notes

- **Secure API Access:** Keep your Cartesia API key safe. Do not hardcode it in public code.  
- **Environment isolation:** Use different keys for dev, staging, and production to ensure clean separation.  
- **Low latency:** Cartesia supports real-time streaming for conversational experiences.  
- **Usage management:** Monitor your Cartesia dashboard for quotas, billing, and usage insights.
