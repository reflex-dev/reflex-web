# Airtable Integration

The **Airtable Integration** lets your apps interact with Airtable bases to **store, fetch, and update structured data** directly from workflows, user actions, or automated triggers. Perfect for managing dynamic content, customer data, or workflows without complex backend setup.


## What You Can Do

With the Airtable Integration, your app can:

* Read and display data from Airtable bases
* Create new records dynamically from user actions
* Update or delete records through workflows
* Power AI experiences with live database content
* Sync structured data without hosting your own database

2. Log in or create a free account.
3. Navigate to [**Developer Hub**](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) from your account menu.
4. Under **Personal access tokens**, click **Create token**.
5. Add the appropriate scopes (e.g. `data.records:read` and `data.records:write`).
6. Copy your API token.
   * Example: `patl2IhDFoZK0Rabc12345xyz`

## Step 2: Configure the Integration in Your App
