# GitHub Integration

The **GitHub Integration** lets your app connect directly to [GitHub](https://github.com) to automate actions, fetch data, and build powerful developer workflows. Once connected, your app can interact with repositories, issues, pull requests, and more.

## What You Can Do

With GitHub, your app can:
- Fetch and display repository data (commits, branches, issues, etc.).  
- Create or update issues, pull requests, and discussions.  
- Trigger workflows or CI/CD pipelines.  
- Sync GitHub activity into your appâ€™s dashboards or automations.  
- Build custom developer tools using GitHubâ€™s API.

## Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token

1. Go to your [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).  
2. Navigate to **Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens**.  
3. Click **Generate new token** (classic or fine-grained).  
4. Select the required scopes (e.g., `repo`, `workflow`, `read:user`).  
5. Copy the token.  
   *Example:*  
```

ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

```

> ðŸ’¡ Fine-grained tokens are recommended for better security.

## Step 2: Configure the Integration in Your App

1. In your app, go to **Integrations â†’ Add GitHub**.  
2. Paste your **GitHub Personal Access Token** in the input field.  
3. Click **Connect** to validate and save your integration.

Once connected, your app can start interacting with GitHub through workflows and actions.

## Step 3: Notes

* **Keep your token secure:** Never expose your GitHub token in public code.  
* **Use fine-grained permissions:** Limit access to only whatâ€™s needed.  
* **API rate limits:** GitHub imposes API limits, so plan automations accordingly.  
* **Combine with AI:** For example, auto-generate release notes from commits or summarize PRs with LLMs.
