## What is reflex cloud config?

The following command:

```bash
reflex cloud config
```

generates a `cloud.yml` configuration file used to deploy your Reflex app to the Reflex cloud platform. This file tells Reflex how and where to run your app in the cloud.


## What does cloud.yml contain?

Here is an example cloud.yml file generated by the command:

```yaml
name: default
description: ''
regions:
  sjc: 1
  lhr: 2
vmtype: c1m1
hostname: null
envfile: .env
project: null
packages:
- procps
```

### Configuration Options Explained

**name**
- Identifies your deployment in the Reflex Cloud dashboard
- Use descriptive names like `myapp-prod` or `myapp-staging`

**description**
- Optional but helpful for team collaboration
- Document what this deployment is for

**regions**
- Available regions: `sjc` (San Jose), `lhr` (London), `fra` (Frankfurt), `syd` (Sydney)
- Format: `region: instance_count`
- Use multiple regions for global availability and redundancy

**vmtype**
- `c1m1`: 1 CPU, 1GB RAM (development/small apps)
- `c2m2`: 2 CPU, 2GB RAM (production ready)
- `c4m4`: 4 CPU, 4GB RAM (high traffic apps)
- `c8m8`: 8 CPU, 8GB RAM (enterprise apps)

**hostname**
- Leave as `null` for default Reflex Cloud URL
- Set custom domain if you own one
- Requires DNS configuration (see Custom Domains section)

**envfile**
- Path to your environment variables file
- Default is `.env` in your project root
- Never commit this file to version control

**project**
- Optional: organizes deployments within your account
- Useful for separating client projects or environments

**packages**
- Additional packages your app needs

### Environment Variables (Optional)

If your app uses environment variables, create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# App Configuration
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Custom Variables
CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Use different `.env` files for staging/production
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use strong, unique values for SECRET_KEY

## How to use the cloud.yml

1. Run reflex cloud config to generate the default `cloud.yml` file.
2. Open `cloud.yml` and customize the keys to fit your app and deployment preferences.
3. Ensure your .env file (or specified envfile) contains the necessary environment variables for your app.
4. Deploy your app using Reflex cloud commands (e.g., reflex deploy).

## Where to find values for keys?

- `regions`: Check Reflex cloud documentation or dashboard for region codes and availability.
- `vmtype`: Check Reflex cloud VM size options to pick the right balance of CPU/memory.
- `hostname`: Use your own domain name if you want a custom URL, or leave as null for default URLs.
- `project`: Your Reflex cloud account projects â€” find them on the Reflex dashboard.
- `packages`: Add any extra packages your app requires to run.

## Summary

Reflex Cloud provides a streamlined deployment experience for Python web applications. The `cloud.yml` configuration file gives you control over your deployment while maintaining simplicity. Start with basic configurations and scale up as your application grows.

For production applications, consider implementing proper monitoring, backup strategies, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure reliable deployments.
