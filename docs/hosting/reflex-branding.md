# Reflex Branding

Remove Reflex branding from your exported or deployed sites. 

By default, Reflex branding, such as the "Built with Reflex" badge, will appear on all your published sites.


## How to remove the Reflex branding from your app

You can turn off the Reflex branding, when deploying to Reflex Cloud, by adding `show_built_with_reflex=False` to the `rx.Config()` in the `rxconfig.py` file. 

In order for this to work a user hosting with Reflex Cloud must be logged in and on a [paid plan]({pricing_path}) (at least pro tier).
