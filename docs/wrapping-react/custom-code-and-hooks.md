When wrapping a React component, you may need to define custom code or hooks that are specific to the component. This is done by defining the `add_custom_code`or `add_hooks` methods in your component class.

## Custom Code

Custom code is any JS code that need to be included in your page, but not necessarily in the component itself. This can include things like CSS styles, JS libraries, or any other code that needs to be included in the page.

```python
class CustomCodeComponent(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    def add_custom_code(self) -> list[str]:
        """Add custom code to the component."""
        code1 = """
        const customVariable = "Custom code1";
        """

        code2 = """
        console.log("Custom code2");
        """

        return [code1, code2]
```

## Custom Hooks
Custom hooks are any hooks that need to be included in your component. This can include things like `useEffect`, `useState`, or any other hooks that need to be included in the component.

- Simple hooks can be added as strings.
- More complex hooks that need to have special import or be written in a specific order can be added as `rx.Var` with a `VarData` object to specify the position of the hook.
    - The `imports` attribute of the `VarData` object can be used to specify any imports that need to be included in the component.
    - The `position` attribute of the `VarData` object can be set to `Hooks.HookPosition.PRE_TRIGGER` or `Hooks.HookPosition.POST_TRIGGER` to specify the position of the hook in the component.

```python
from reflex.vars.base import Var, VarData
from reflex.constants import Hooks

class ComponentWithHooks(MyBaseComponent):
    """MyComponent."""

    def add_hooks(self) -> list[str| Var]:
        """Add hooks to the component."""
        hooks = []
        hooks1 = """
        useEffect(() => {
            console.log("Hook1");
        }, []);
        """
        hooks.append(hooks1)

        # A hook that need to be written before the memoized event handlers.
        hooks2 = Var(
            """
            useState(() => {
                console.log("Hook2");
            }, []);
            """,
            var_data=VarData(position=Hooks.HookPosition.PRE_TRIGGER),
        )
        hooks.append(hooks2)

        return hooks
```
