title: Wrapping Local Packages

```python exec
import reflex as rx
```

# Assets

If a wrapped component depends on assets such as images, scripts, or
stylesheets, these can be kept adjacent to the component code and
included in the final build using the `rx.asset` function.

`rx.asset` returns a relative path that references the asset in the compiled
output. The target files are copied into a subdirectory of `assets/external`
based on the module where they are initially used. This allows third-party
components to have external assets with the same name without conflicting
with each other.

For example, if there is an SVG file named `wave.svg` in the same directory as
this component, it can be rendered using `rx.image` and `rx.asset`.

```python
class Hello(rx.Component):
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, *children, **props) -> rx.Component:
        props.setdefault("align", "center")
        return rx.hstack(
            rx.image(src=rx.asset("wave.svg", shared=True), width="50px", height="50px"),
            rx.heading("Hello ", *children),
            **props
        )
```


# Local Components

You can also wrap components that you have written yourself. For local components (when the code source is directly in the project), we recommend putting it beside the files that is wrapping it.

If there is a file `hello.jsx` in the same directory as the component with this content:

```javascript
// /path/to/components/hello.jsx
import React from 'react';

export function Hello({name, onGreet}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => onGreet(name)}>Greet</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The python app can use the `rx.asset` helper to copy the component source into
the generated frontend, after which the `library` path in the `rx.Component` may
be specified by prefixing `$/public` to that path returned by `rx.asset`.

```python
import reflex as rx

hello_path = rx.asset("./hello.jsx", shared=True)
hello_css_path = rx.asset("./hello.css", shared=True)

class Hello(rx.Component):
    # Use an absolute path starting with $/public
    library = f"$/public{hello_path}"

    # Define everything else as normal.
    tag = "Hello"

    name: rx.Var[str] = rx.Var("World")
    on_greet: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(str)]

    # Include any related CSS files with rx.asset to ensure they are copied.
    def add_imports(self):
        return {"": f"$/public/{hello_css_path}"}
```

## Considerations

When wrapping local components, keep the following in mind:

1. **File Extensions**: Ensure that the file extensions are correct (e.g., `.jsx` for React components and `.tsx` for TypeScript components).
2. **Asset Management**: Use `rx.asset` with `shared=True` to manage any assets (e.g., images, styles) that the component depends on.
3. **Event Handling**: Define any event handlers (e.g., `on_greet`) as part of the component's API and pass those to the component _from the Reflex app_. Do not attempt to hook into Reflex's event system directly from Javascript.

## Use Case

Local components are useful when shimming small pieces of functionality that are
simpler or more performant when implemented directly in Javascript, such as:

* Spammy events: keys, touch, mouse, scroll -- these are often better processed on the client side.
* Using canvas, graphics or WebGPU
* Working with other Web APIs like storage, screen capture, audio/midi
* Integrating with complex third-party libraries
  * For application-specific use, it may be easier to wrap a local component that
    provides the needed subset of the library's functionality in a simpler API for use in Reflex.

# Local Packages

If the component is part of a local package, available on Github, or
downloadable via a web URL, it can also be wrapped in Reflex. Specify the path
or URL after an `@` following the package name.

Any local paths are relative to the `.web` folder, so you can use `../` prefix
to reference the Reflex project root.

Some examples of valid specifiers for a package called 
[`@masenf/hello-react`](https://github.com/masenf/hello-react) are:

* GitHub: `@masenf/hello-react@github:masenf/hello-react`
* URL: `@masenf/hello-react@https://github.com/masenf/hello-react/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz`
* Local Archive: `@masenf/hello-react@../hello-react.tgz`
* Local Directory: `@masenf/hello-react@../hello-react`

It is important that the package name matches the name in `package.json` so
Reflex can generate the correct import statement in the generated javascript
code.

These package specifiers can be used for `library` or `lib_dependencies`.

```python demo exec toggle
class GithubComponent(rx.Component):
    library = "@masenf/hello-react@github:masenf/hello-react"
    tag = "Counter"

    def add_imports(self):
        return {
            "": ["@masenf/hello-react/dist/style.css"]
        }

def github_component_example():
    return GithubComponent.create()
```

Although more complicated, this approach is useful when the local components
have additional dependencies or build steps required to prepare the component
for use.

Some important notes regarding this approach:

* The repo or archive must contain a `package.json` file.
* `prepare` or `build` scripts will NOT be executed. The distribution archive,
  directory, or repo must already contain the built javascript files (this is common).

```md alert
# Ensure CSS files are exported in `package.json`

In addition to exporting the module containing the component, any CSS files
intended to be imported by the wrapped component must also be listed in the
`exports` key of `package.json`.

```json
{
  // ...,
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/index.js",
      "require": "./dist/index.umd.cjs"
    },
    "./dist/style.css": {
      "import": "./dist/style.css",
      "require": "./dist/style.css"
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```
