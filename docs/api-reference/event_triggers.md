# Event Triggers

Components can modify the state based on user events such as clicking a button or entering text in a field.
These events are triggered by event triggers.

Event triggers are component specific and are listed in the documentation for each component.

## Component Lifecycle Events

Reflex components have lifecycle events like `on_mount` and `on_unmount` that allow you to execute code at specific points in a component's existence. These events are crucial for initializing data, cleaning up resources, and creating dynamic user interfaces.

### When Lifecycle Events Are Activated

- **on_mount**: This event is triggered immediately after a component is rendered and attached to the DOM. It fires:
  - When a page containing the component is first loaded
  - When a component is conditionally rendered (appears after being hidden)
  - When navigating to a page containing the component using internal navigation
  - It does NOT fire when the page is refreshed or when following external links

- **on_unmount**: This event is triggered just before a component is removed from the DOM. It fires:
  - When navigating away from a page containing the component using internal navigation
  - When a component is conditionally removed from the DOM (e.g., via a condition that hides it)
  - It does NOT fire when refreshing the page, closing the browser tab, or following external links

## Page Load Events

In addition to component lifecycle events, Reflex also provides page-level events like `on_load` that are triggered when a page loads. The `on_load` event is useful for:

- Fetching data when a page first loads
- Checking authentication status
- Initializing page-specific state
- Setting default values for cookies or browser storage

You can specify an event handler to run when the page loads using the `on_load` parameter in the `@rx.page` decorator or `app.add_page()` method:

```python
class State(rx.State):
    data: dict = dict()

    @rx.event
    def get_data(self):
        # Fetch data when the page loads
        self.data = fetch_data()

@rx.page(on_load=State.get_data)
def index():
    return rx.text('Data loaded on page load')
```

This is particularly useful for authentication checks:

```python
class State(rx.State):
    authenticated: bool = False

    @rx.event
    def check_auth(self):
        # Check if user is authenticated
        self.authenticated = check_auth()
        if not self.authenticated:
            return rx.redirect('/login')

@rx.page(on_load=State.check_auth)
def protected_page():
    return rx.text('Protected content')
```

For more details on page load events, see the [page load events documentation]({events.page_load_events.path}).
