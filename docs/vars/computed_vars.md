# Computed Vars

Computed vars have values derived from other properties on the backend. They are
defined as methods in your State class with the `@rx.var` decorator. A computed
var is recomputed every time an event is processed in your app.

Try typing in the input box and clicking out.

```python demo exec id=upper
class UppercaseState(rx.State):
    text: str = "hello"

    @rx.var
    def upper_text(self) -> str:
        # This will be recomputed whenever `text` changes.
        return self.text.upper()


def uppercase_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(UppercaseState.upper_text),
        rx.input(on_blur=UppercaseState.set_text, placeholder="Type here..."),
    )
```

Here, `upper_text` is a computed var that always holds the upper case version of `text`.

We recommend always using type annotations for computed vars.

## Cached Vars

A cached var, decorated as `@rx.var(cache=True)` is a special type of computed var
that is only recomputed when the other state vars it depends on change. This is
useful for expensive computations, but in some cases it may not update when you
expect it to.
Previous versions of Reflex had a `@rx.cached_var` decorator, which is now replaced
by the new `cache` argument of `@rx.var`.

```python demo exec
class CachedVarState(rx.State):
    counter_a: int = 0
    counter_b: int = 0

    @rx.var
    def last_touch_time(self) -> str:
        # This is updated anytime the state is updated.
        return time.strftime("%H:%M:%S")

    @rx.event
    def increment_a(self):
        self.counter_a += 1

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def last_counter_a_update(self) -> str:
        # This is updated only when `counter_a` changes.
        return f"{self.counter_a} at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}"

    @rx.event
    def increment_b(self):
        self.counter_b += 1

    @rx.var(cache=True)
    def last_counter_b_update(self) -> str:
        # This is updated only when `counter_b` changes.
        return f"{self.counter_b} at {time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}"


def cached_var_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.text(f"State touched at: {CachedVarState.last_touch_time}"),
        rx.text(f"Counter A: {CachedVarState.last_counter_a_update}"),
        rx.text(f"Counter B: {CachedVarState.last_counter_b_update}"),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Increment A", on_click=CachedVarState.increment_a),
            rx.button("Increment B", on_click=CachedVarState.increment_b),
        ),
    )
```

In this example `last_touch_time` is a normal computed var, which updates any
time the state is modified. `last_counter_a_update` is a computed var that only
depends on `counter_a`, so it only gets recomputed when `counter_a` has changes.
Similarly `last_counter_b_update` only depends on `counter_b`, and thus is
updated only when `counter_b` changes.

## Async Computed Vars

Async computed vars allow you to use asynchronous operations in your computed vars.
They are defined as async methods in your State class with the same `@rx.var` decorator.
Async computed vars are useful for operations that require asynchronous processing, such as:

- Fetching data from external APIs
- Database operations
- File I/O operations
- Any other operations that benefit from async/await

```python demo exec
class AsyncVarState(rx.State):
    count: int = 0
    
    @rx.var
    async def delayed_count(self) -> int:
        # Simulate an async operation like an API call
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        return self.count * 2
    
    @rx.event
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1


def async_var_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Async Computed Var Example"),
        rx.text(f"Count: {AsyncVarState.count}"),
        rx.text(f"Delayed count (x2): {AsyncVarState.delayed_count}"),
        rx.button("Increment", on_click=AsyncVarState.increment),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

In this example, `delayed_count` is an async computed var that returns the count multiplied by 2 after a simulated delay.
When the count changes, the async computed var is automatically recomputed.

### Caching Async Computed Vars

Just like regular computed vars, async computed vars can also be cached. This is especially
useful for expensive async operations like API calls or database queries.

```python demo exec
class AsyncCachedVarState(rx.State):
    user_id: int = 1
    refresh_trigger: int = 0
    
    @rx.var(cache=True)
    async def user_data(self) -> dict:
        # In a real app, this would be an API call
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate network delay
        
        # Simulate different user data based on user_id
        users = {
            1: {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
            2: {"name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"},
            3: {"name": "Charlie", "email": "charlie@example.com"},
        }
        
        return users.get(self.user_id, {"name": "Unknown", "email": "unknown"})
    
    @rx.event
    def change_user(self):
        # Cycle through users 1-3
        self.user_id = (self.user_id % 3) + 1
    
    @rx.event
    def force_refresh(self):
        # This will not affect user_data dependencies, but will trigger a state update
        self.refresh_trigger += 1


def async_cached_var_example():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading("Cached Async Computed Var Example"),
        rx.text(f"User ID: {AsyncCachedVarState.user_id}"),
        rx.text(f"User Name: {AsyncCachedVarState.user_data['name']}"),
        rx.text(f"User Email: {AsyncCachedVarState.user_data['email']}"),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Change User", on_click=AsyncCachedVarState.change_user),
            rx.button("Force Refresh (No Effect)", on_click=AsyncCachedVarState.force_refresh),
        ),
        rx.text("Note: The cached async var only updates when user_id changes, not when refresh_trigger changes."),
        spacing="4",
    )
```

In this example, `user_data` is a cached async computed var that simulates fetching user data.
It is only recomputed when `user_id` changes, not when other state variables like `refresh_trigger` change.
This demonstrates how caching works with async computed vars to optimize performance for expensive operations.
