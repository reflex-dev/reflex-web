# Authentication Overview

Many apps require authentication to manage users. There are a few different ways to accomplish this in Reflex:

We have solutions here:

1. Local Auth: Uses your own database: https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-examples/tree/main/twitter
2. Google Auth: Uses sign in with Google: https://reflex.dev/blog/2023-10-25-implementing-sign-in-with-google/
3. Captcha: Generates tests that humans can pass but automated systems cannot: https://github.com/masenf/reflex-google-recaptcha-v2
4. Magic Link Auth: A passwordless login method that sends a unique, one-time-use URL to a user's email: https://github.com/masenf/reflex-magic-link-auth
5. Clerk Auth: A community member wrapped this component and hooked it up in this app: https://github.com/kroo/reflex-clerk
